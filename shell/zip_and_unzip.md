## Terminal Lesson

So I started deeping into the terminal and this has opened my eye to lot of things. There are some redundant tools I have on my machine that are pretty useless.

- I just noticed I have a tool that can help me zip and unzip my files
```
$ zip -r name_of_zip_file folder_to_zip
```

#### Little explanation
- zip is a terminal tool
- -r will recursively loop through your files and zip it
- name_of_zip_file: This is the name you want to call your zip, if it is already available, zip will update the files that have been zipped
- folder_to_zip: What you want to zip

```
$ unzip name_of_zip
```
I also have unzip that will unzip my files and interactively tell you to rename and do lot of cool things

#### I am not leaving my terminal soon, all those useless apps will be deleted today

#### Do you know you can check the date and calendar on your calendar?
- cal and date will do the trick
